# HR_Analytics_Dashboard

## 👥 Project Overview
This Power BI project provides a comprehensive analysis of employee attendance and work-style preferences. By transforming daily attendance logs into actionable visual insights, the dashboard helps HR teams monitor workforce stability, track hybrid work adoption, and manage employee wellness through presence and leave metrics.

## 📊 Key Insights & Metrics
* **Presence Rate:** Maintained a strong **91.83% overall presence rate** across the analyzed period.
* **Hybrid Work Trends:** Identified a **10.00% Work From Home (WFH) rate**, with Fridays consistently showing the highest remote work engagement (13.01%).
* **Wellness Monitoring:** Tracked a controlled **1.10% Sick Leave (SL) rate**, utilizing trend lines to spot health-related absences.
* **Weekly Patterns:** Discovered that **Mondays** exhibit the highest physical presence at **93.21%**.
* **Employee Granularity:** Developed detailed tracking for individual work statuses (Present, WFH, Half-Pay Leave) to allow for precise administrative oversight.
